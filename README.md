cmp-analysis
============

Data analysis code and results for the Censorship Monitoring Project

The code for data analysis is split into two directories:
1. statistics-computation: this contains the Python scripts for computing features from the exported filter robe results data.
2. plotting-scripts: this contains the R scripts for plotting the performance of the filters.

For now you access the nightly CSV dumps of filter data located [here](https://api.blocked.org.uk/data/export.csv.gz)
